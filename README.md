This is an app to help students with school. It's main functions are:

- AI chat to create notes and answer your questions based on the school books and publicly available data;

- interactive quizzes generator to check your knowledge before the next school test;

- PowerPoint draft generator to kickstart your work with presentations.

I started working on this app when I was just begginning playing with JavaScript and it's my largest project I've ever worked on. I'm sure that I spent at least 150+ hours on it.

This app was done in Polish language, so I'm sorry if you don't understand much.

Tech stack used:

- NodeJS server with express
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Socket.io for communication between backend and frontend
- MongoDB as a database
- Gemini API for all the AI magic
- PptxGenJS to create PowerPoint files
- and moreâ€¦

I'm hosting this app on HackClub's Nest!
